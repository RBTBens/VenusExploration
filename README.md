The circumference of the circle of the wheels is 36.128cm
When each wheel has given one encoder pulse, that means the rotated angle is
(1.316 / 36.128) * 360 = 13.11326014595066683023762986702

- Item 1

Ideas
===
- Make syncing of wheels by checking delays between pulses, getting the longest delay and slowing the speed of the other servo to that value
