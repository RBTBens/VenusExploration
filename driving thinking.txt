let each encoder get N amount of ticks

------------

11.5cm diameter of the circle (distance between edges of both wheels)

one pulse is 13.16mm driven by one wheel
with two wheels this is multiplied by 2, so 2.632cm

The circumference of the circle is 36.128cm
When each wheel has given one encoder pulse, that means the rotated angle is
(2.632 / 36.128) * 360 = 26.226

To correct the error we can constantly keep track of how far
into a pulse the encoders/wheels are

OR

When we get the instruction to do a 20 degree rotation, only rotate 20/26 of a pulse with timing?
